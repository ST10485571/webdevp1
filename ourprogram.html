          <h3>Harvest Hubs: Food Rescue Program</h3>
          <p>
            Our "Harvest Hubs" are the heart of our food rescue efforts. We partner with local and global supermarket chains to collect surplus, near-expiry, or aesthetically imperfect yet perfectly edible food items. This includes fresh produce, baked goods, and packaged foods that would otherwise go to waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our dedicated teams ensure safe collection, rigorous quality checks, and careful sorting. The food is then packaged into nutritious meal kits or bulk supplies, ready for distribution to those in need. This program not only feeds hungry individuals but also significantly reduces food waste in South Africa.

          <h3>Dignity Threads: Clothing & Essentials</h3>
          <p>
            Through our "Dignity Threads" initiative, we provide essential clothing and hygiene items to the homeless. We collaborate with leading local retail brands to receive donations of unsold stock, factory seconds, or returned items.
          </p>
          <p>
            These items are meticulously sorted, cleaned, and prepared into "Dignity Packs" â€“ offering a complete outfit, socks, underwear, and basic hygiene products. This program ensures that individuals not only receive necessary items but also experience the dignity that comes with appropriate and clean attire.
