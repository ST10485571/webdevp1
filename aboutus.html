                        The Kamvelihle Harvest Foundation is dedicated to combating food and clothing insecurity among South Africa's homeless and vulnerable populations by efficiently collecting and distributing quality donated surplus from local and global partners, fostering community, and restoring dignity through the spirit of Ubuntu.

                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                        Our vision is a South Africa where no person experiences the indignity of hunger or the hardship of inadequate clothing, and where communities flourish through shared resources and compassionate action.

                    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                        The Kamvelihle Harvest Foundation (KHF) was born in late 2022 from the stark reality of food waste amidst widespread hunger in South Africa. What started as a small, volunteer-driven effort in Johannesburg quickly grew, fueled by the spirit of Ubuntu. By mid-2023, KHF formalized as an NPC and secured PBO status, attracting partnerships with major supermarkets like Shoprite and Pick n Pay. The past year has seen accelerated growth, with collaborations extending to retail brands like PEP Stores and Woolworths for clothing, and crucial endorsements from South African celebrities such as Nomzamo Mbatha and Siya Kolisi. This support, combined with significant investment from philanthropists and corporate foundations, has enabled us to expand our reach, establishing key "Harvest Hubs" in major urban centers.
